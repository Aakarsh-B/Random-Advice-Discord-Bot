# Random-Advice-Discord-Bot
A discord bot that provides a random advice whenever we ask for one.
<br>
I had created a react app recently which collects info from an API and displays it on a webpage. Here, I used the same API, along with a little bit of python to convert it into a discord bot which gives us random advice on a command trigger.
